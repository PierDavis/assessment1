// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//Reordered:
//Planning
//Analysis of Requirements
//Design
//Implementation
//Testing & Integration
//Maintenance

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.

 *///let Step1 = {name: "Analysis Of Requirements", definition: "Text here"}
// // console.log(Step1.definition)
// let sldc = [{name: "Analysis Of Requirements", definition: "Text here"},
// {name: "Design", definition: "Text here2"}]
// //console.log(sldc)
// console.log("definition2", sldc[1].definition)
